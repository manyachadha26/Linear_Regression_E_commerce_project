# Linear_Regression_E_commerce_project
This dataset is having data of customers who buys clothes online. The store offers in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
based on various variables available in this dataset, we're going to predict how much a customer is going to spend in a year and in the end we're going to evaluate how well our model is at giving these predictions.
